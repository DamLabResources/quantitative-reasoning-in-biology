This margin should be determined based on clinical or practical relevance.\n",

    "   - The first test checks if the upper confidence limit of the difference between treatments is less than the positive equivalence margin.\n",

    " - Interpret the Results: Equivalence is concluded if both one-sided tests reject their respective null hypotheses at a predetermined significance level.\n",
