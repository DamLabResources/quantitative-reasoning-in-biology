# Module 1


## Introduction and Overview


Welcome to the first week of Applied Statistics for Biomedical Sciences.

Welcome to Week 1 of our 16-week exploration of biological data analysis! 
This week, we will start by introducing you to the Google Colab environment and Python programming.

Throughout this course, we will be working with a variety of datasets, including those related to protein expression in malaria parasites, HIV patient clinical information, and bacterial gene content.
While the specific data we'll be working with may vary, the techniques we use to load, visualize, and analyze it will be consistent.

To get started, please watch the introductions from your instructional team and then read the "About Weekly Coursework" document.
After that, you can begin working through the Learning Activities for this week, which include reading the first two chapters of the Inferential Thinking textbook and completing the paired programming walkthrough and programming challenge.

I'm looking forward to diving into the exciting world of data analysis with you all!

## About Weekly Coursework


Each week you will open a page like this one. Most of the pages are organized the same way:
 - Introduction and Overview
 - Special Instructions/Notes, as needed
 - Required synchronous sessions, if any
 - * Learning Activities *
 - Topic-specific Questions
 - Conclusion/Wrap-up

The *Learning Activities* folder contains the various assignments you will complete to learn the key terms, concepts, methods, etc. related to biomedical statistics and how to apply them in your current or future work. 
In general, but not always, the series of learning activities are to:
 - Read textbook material. (~30 min) 
 - Review available supplemental materials (1 hr) 
 - Complete the paired programming walkthrough. (1-2hr) 
 - Complete the lab. (1-3 hr) 


## Special Instructions


There is a required synchronous session this week. Check the course calendar, announcements, or your syllabus schedule for the date and time.


## Learning Objectives


The learning objectives are an essential instructional element; they inform you where to focus your learning efforts and how.
Therefore, this course will post weekly learning objectives with the associated learning activities to provide you with better guidance.


## Learning Activities

This folder contains the learning activities you need to complete by the end of this week. 
For example, this week you will read the first two chapters of the Inferential Thinking textbook. 
Then you will complete the Paired Programming Walkthrough and Video Quiz to help you get started with Python. 


### Read: Textbook

This week there is no reading in your textbook.
However, we will cover how to perform the excercises in the book using the public GitHub.

### Participate: Lecture Walkthrough

Google Colab is a powerful tool that allows researchers and data scientists to write and execute code, analyze data, and collaborate on projects from anywhere with an internet connection.
It's free to use and requires no setup or installation, making it an ideal platform for data analysis tasks.

In this week's learning activity, we will introduce you to the basics of using Google Colab.
We'll show you how to log in, execute code, write text using Markdown, and export your work for submission. 

You do not need to have anything downloaded or installed in advance of this activity.
It will all be covered during the video.

By following along with the video, you'll learn how to:

 - Launch Google Colab
 - Create text using Markdown.
 - Execute code cells.
 - Check your answers with the `Otter` grading system.
 - Submit assignments to BBLearn.

Google Colab is widely used by researchers around the world and is an important tool to have in your data analysis toolkit.
After completing this learning activity, you'll have a strong foundation in using Google Colab and be well on your way to using it to tackle real-world data problems.
Please make sure to respond to the quiz questions as they appear in the video.

Note:

When downloading the files, it is important that you do not unzip them.
If your browser unzips them automatically during the download process, you will need to turn this feature off.
The steps to do this vary depending on which browser you are using (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.).
To find out how to disable this feature in your browser, try searching online for a phrase like "how to stop [browser name] from unzipping downloaded files."

If you continue to have difficulty with this, you can schedule a meeting through the booking link to get help from an instructor.

### Complete: Lab

None this week.



## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this first week of exploring data analysis! 
By getting familiar with Google Colab, you've laid the foundation for the next 16 weeks of this course.

In the next week, we'll continue to use Google Colab as we delve into basic math and calculating dilutions.
We'll apply these concepts to a real-world scenario, using Google Colab to perform calculations related to running a Nanopore sequencing run.
These skills will be crucial as we move forward in the course and tackle more complex data analysis tasks.

I'm excited to see what you'll be able to accomplish as you continue to develop your skills in data analysis.
I hope this first week has sparked your curiosity and interest in this field, and I look forward to diving deeper into these topics with you in the weeks ahead.
