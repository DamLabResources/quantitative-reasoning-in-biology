    "In the COVID sequencing lab we often have to evaluate multiple techniques for preparing viral samples for sequencing.\n",
    "There are *many* aspects to this comparison, but one important one is the yield of the reaction that prepares DNA for sequencing.\n",
    "This reaction is called an RT-PCR reaction because it _reverse-transcribes_ the nCov2 RNA into DNA through a _polymerase chain reaction_.\n",

    "Currently, our lab uses a system with over 200 pairs of overlapping PCR primers that generate DNA fragments that are, on average, **285 basepairs** long.\n",

    "Short RT-PCR fragments are ideal when dealing with degraded RNA because it allows for the amplification of even shredded RNA.\n",
