# Dilution calculations

This will be some content reviewing calculating DNA dilutions.

If it has been a while since you've done unit conversions, you can review this [link](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fourth-grade-math/imp-measurement-and-data-2/imp-conversion-word-problems/v/multi-step-unit-conversion-examples) for a refresher. And for a more DNA-focused explanation you can look at this [link](https://bitesizebio.com/20669/how-to-calculate-the-number-of-molecules-in-any-piece-of-dna/). When I need a quick calculation I tend to use this [NEB Calculator](https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/dsdnaamt).
