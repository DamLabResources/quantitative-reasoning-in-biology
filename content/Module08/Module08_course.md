# Module 8: Hypothesis Testing

## Overview

This week we'll explore hypothesis testing and statistical comparisons in biological experiments.

## Learning Resources

### Having Trouble with Syntax or Errors?

If you're getting stuck on Python syntax or encountering errors, check out these helpful guides:

- **[Python Syntax Quick Reference](../misc/python_syntax_guide.md)** - Quick lookup for brackets, indexing, and common pandas operations
- **[Troubleshooting Common Errors](../misc/troubleshooting_errors.md)** - Understand and fix common Python errors

### Need More Practice?

- **[Module 8 Practice Problems](Module08_practice.ipynb)** - Optional practice problems with solutions (not graded)

## Learning Activities

### Read: Textbook

Review the textbook material on hypothesis testing.

### Participate: Lecture Walkthrough  

Complete the Module 8 walkthrough notebook.

### Complete: Lab

Apply what you've learned in the Module 8 lab assignment.

## Getting Help

- **Office Hours**: Thursday 8 PM at the course Zoom link
- **Discussion Board**: Post conceptual questions
- **For coding help**: Attend office hours or TA sessions (coding errors are hard to diagnose asynchronously)

## Tips for Success

1. **Check your syntax** - Use the [syntax guide](../misc/python_syntax_guide.md) when uncertain
2. **Read error messages** - The [troubleshooting guide](../misc/troubleshooting_errors.md) can help you understand what went wrong
3. **Practice, practice, practice** - Try the optional practice problems
4. **Ask for help early** - Don't wait until the deadline to seek assistance
