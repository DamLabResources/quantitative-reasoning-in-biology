Introduction: 
Substance use disorder (SUD) is a worldwide public health concern that imposes significant social, economic, and interpersonal burden. In people with HIV (PWH), SUD co-morbidity is associated with increased viremia, dysregulated immune system, and worsened prognosis. These data are supported by studies in rodent and non-human primate models of HIV infection exposed to stimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. Not only do all recreational substances of misuse increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, but stimulants can also dysregulate dopamine in the peripheral immune system. We have previously summarized the literature on dopamine concentrations throughout the body, which have reported nanomolar to micromolar concentrations of dopamine in different tissues. Thus, it is possible that a means by which stimulants dysregulate the immune system is through altered dopamine transmission in both the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery, and that the well-documented expression of dopamine receptors on various immune cells responds to dopamine to modulate their function. We have previously shown that human monocyte derived macrophages (hMDMs) express D1-like and D2-like receptors and that HIV kinetics are accelerated in the presence of dopamine. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated altered inflammatory activity in primary macrophages following dopamine exposure, which together suggest that dopamine can function as an immune signaling molecule. A key function of myeloid cells such as hMDMs and microglia, the brain's chief resident immune cell, is phagocytosis. Phagocytosis enables myeloid cells to perform many homeostatic functions, such as sequester and digest pathogens, foreign material and damaged host cells; re-model extracellular matrix; present antigens to other immune cells; and, in the nervous system, remodel synapses. Although phagocytosis is a critical function of myeloid cells, the effects of dopamine exposure on this biological process is not well understood. The few studies available in the literature have reported conflicting effects of dopamine on phagocytic activity depending on the concentration of dopamine used. We sought to explore this further using primary blood-derived human macrophages and a high-content analysis platform to analyze phagocytic capacity at the single-cell level. 


Method: We piloted a method to perform a comprehensive in vitro assessment of phagocytosis in hMDMs following treatment with a broad range of dopamine. 

Cell Culture:
We have observed (manuscript in preparation) incongruent immune response of hMDMs depending on the culture conditions used. Here, we cultured hMDMs from the same donor in two different media conditions: one in DMEM base medium and one in RPMI base medium. DMEM is generally used to culture adherent cells while RPMI is typically used to culture cells in suspension, such as T cells. However, there is no consensus in the field regarding the most physiologically relevant culture condition for studying hMDMs in vitro and both are used interchangeably, so we chose to culture hMDMs in both media conditions in parallel. Briefly, leukocyte-enriched blood units were obtained from the New York Blood Center (NYBC) and tested by the NYBC for a panel of viral infections to confirm the sample was safe to use. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll-based density gradient centrifugation to remove granulocytes and erythrocytes. 10 million PBMCs were used for monocyte isolation using a CD14 negative isolation kit, and the total percentage of monocytes was calculated. 20,000 monocytes were plated per well in a 96-well optical plate in either DMEM or RPMI medium, each supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 5% Human-AB serum, 1% HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% Pen/Strep, and 10ng/mL M-CSF. At 3 days in-vitro (DIV3), a full media change was performed, and experiments were conducted on DIV7. 

Phagocytosis Assay:
pH-sensitive latex beads coated to S. aureus bioparticles (pHrodo beads) were purchased from Thermofisher and re-constituted in either plain DMEM or plain RPMI medium to a final concentration of 1mg/mL. Upon phagocytosis, endosomes fuse with lysosomes, which decreases the pH and enables digestion of biological material. However, instead of being digested, pHrodo beads retain their shape and fluoresce within the lysosome, indicating phagocytosis and lysosomal fusion. Initially reconstituted pHrodo beads (1mg/mL) were sonicated for 5 minutes at 4degC and aliquoted before freezing and storage in -20. On the day of the experiment, beads were thawed and vortexed thoroughly before dilution into the culture medium. The preliminary optimization of our high-content phagocytosis assay revealed a dose-dependent response to phagocytosis from 0.5ug/mL up to 50ug/mL, with a maximal phagocytosis observed around 15ug/mL (manuscript in preparation). Therefore, the concentrations tested in this assay ranged from 2.5ug/mL to 10ug/mL (2.5ug/mL, 5ug/mL, 7.5ug/mL, and 10ug/mL) to assess whether the effect of dopamine on phagocytosis depends on concentration of pHrodo beads. Primary hMDMs were pre-treated with dopamine (10-6M to 10-15M) for 45 minutes, and pHrodo beads were added for 1 hour. All concentrations of dopamine for all pHrodo concentrations in both culture conditions were run in three technical replicates.  Following 1hr of pHrodo treatment, hMDMs were washed once with room temperature (RT) 1x HBSS and fixed using cold 4% PFA at RT in the dark for 15 minutes. Wells were washed once in 1x PBS at RT, permeabilized using 0.1% Triton-X for 10 minutes at RT, and stained with DAPI (1:20,000) and CellMaskDeepRed Plasma Membrane Stain (1:20,000) for 10 minutes at RT in the dark. Plates were stored at 4degC until they were ready to be imaged, but were allowed to reach RT for up to 45 minutes before imaging. Cells were imaged within 24h post-fixation to obtain the maximal fluorescence signal of pHrodo beads. Preliminary studies showed that the relative pHrodo signal was preserved for up to 72 hours post-fixation. 

High Content Imaging and Analysis: 
Fixed and stained cells were imaged using the CellInsight CX7 automated high-content imaging system at 40x magnification. 78 fields were captued per well in a spiral formation from the center of the well. pHrodo beads was detected at the 555 channel (Channel 2, Ch2), while CellMaskDeepRed was detected at the 650 channel (Channel 1, Ch1). A SpotDetector analysis program on the HCS Studio software was used to analyze the images. Briefly, each cell was identified using the CellMaskDeepRed membrane border and was used to calculate cell size. Furthermore, the number of pHrodo spots within each cell was counted, along with the area per spot and total area of pHrodo fluorescence within each cell. The raw data were exported to a csv file, and each row in the raw data file represents the result for each individual cell. The following parameters were exported: 

XCentroid: X-position of the cell relative to the whole plate (this is not important for our assay) 
YCentroid: Y-position of the cell relative to the whole plate (not important for our assay) 
ObjectArea: Area of the object based on pixel size (useful) 
ObjectTotalIntenCh1: The total intensity of Channel 1, AKA the sum of intensities of all pixels within the border of each identified and discrete cell, for the CellMaskDeepRed plasma membrane stain (not biologically relevant) 
ObjectAvgIntenCh1: The average intensity of Channel 1, AKA the average intensity of all pixels within the border of each identified and discrete cell, for all CellMaskDeepRed plasma mebrane stain (not biologically relevant) 
ObjectAvgIntenCh1: The variation (standard deviation) of intensity of Channel 1, AKA the standard deviation of intensity of the average of all pixels within the border of each identified and discrete cell, for all CellMaskDeepRed plasma mebrane stain (not biologically relevant) 
SpotCountCh2: The number of spots, AKA discrete pHrodo puncta, detected by the software within each cell (Important) 
SpotTotalAreaCh2: The total area of all counted spots detected by the software within each cell (Important)
SpotAvgAreaCh2: The average area per spot detected by the software within each cell (Important, because it tells you whether some spots are bigger than others. Endosomes can fuse with one another and so multiple beads can end up within the same endosome and downstream acidified lysosome. If you have larger endosomes, then you may see a larger area per spot)
SpotTotalIntenCh2: The average total intensity per spot. It sums alll pixel intensities for each individual spots, and calculates the total insensity per spot, then it averages this to give you the intensity per spot within each cell (Important, because pH sensitive beads will fluoresce more as the pH decreases from pH 7 to pH 3, and this has been shown in the literature as well as the product's internal data. If the intensity is higher, you may have a lower-pH lysosome).
SpotAvgIntenCh2: The intensity per pixel for all spots detected by the software within each cell (Not as meaningful to us because it is the brightness per pixel and that is too granular to be meaningful).
TotalIntenCh2: The sum of all intensity of all pixels within each discrete cell (this includes the pixels that have no pHordo fluorescence at all, so it is not very meaningful) 
AvgIntenCh2: The average intensity of all pixels within each discrete cell (this includes the pixels that have no pHrodo fluorescence at all so it is not very meaningful) 


The data that are spit out by the analysis software do not enable connecting the results to a plate map, so we have to generate our own plate map and concatenate this to the data file. Plus, because there were so many conditions, the experiments were run in 4 separate 96-well plates, and these data need to be concatenated, too. However, the plate map is not the same for all plates. For plates with 5ug/mL pHrodo beads and the 7.5ug/mL pHrodo beads, the whole plate is DMEM, but half has 5ug/mL and half has 7.5ug/mL pHrodo beads. For plates with 2.5ug/mL pHrodo OR 10ug/mL pHrodo beads, half the plate is in DMEM and half the plate is RPMI, but the whole plate has one concentration of pHrodo beads. Therefore, two different plate maps needed to be created on a text file. One plate map will be concatenated with the 5ug and 7ug DMEM file or RPMI file, while the other plate map will be concatenated with the 2ug file and the 10ug file.
