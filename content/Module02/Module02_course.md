# Module 2

## Introduction and Overview

Welcome to Week 2 of our course!

This week, we'll be exploring how to use Python to automate common lab tasks such as counting cells on a plate, normalizing values with a reference, and calculating dilutions for stock chemicals.
Automating these tasks can reduce the time it takes to get them done, making your work more efficient and effective.

To illustrate these concepts, we'll be using a real-world example from molecular biology: preparing samples for DNA sequencing using a Nanopore sequencer.
These devices are small, portable, and inexpensive, making them an attractive option for researchers who need to read millions of bases of DNA in a short period of time.
However, preparing samples for sequencing can involve a lot of tedious calculations, and that's where Python comes in.

This week, as a case study, we'll be using a Senior Design Project I advised which used a Nanopore sequencer to track the nCov2 transmission in the Drexel community.
If you'd like to learn more about this project, be sure to watch the video explaining it in the recommended materials.

I hope you're looking forward to learning how to use Python to automate your lab work.
Let's get started!

## Conclusion

This week, we explored the basics of arithmetic in Python, and learned how each tool can be useful in scientific exploration.
We used Python to compare the yield of two different RT-PCR methods for preparing viral samples for nanopore sequencing.
While this task was a trivial calculation we saw how Python can be a valuable tool in data analysis.
As we move forward in this course, we will use Python to manipulate spreadsheets and perform advanced data analysis techniques that would be difficult or impossible to do in Excel alone.
