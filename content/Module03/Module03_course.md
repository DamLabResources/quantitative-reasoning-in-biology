# Module 3

## Introduction and Overview

This week we will dive into exploring and analyzing a real-world dataset of about People Living with HIV (PLwH).
Using basic data exploration and summarization techniques, we will look at the effect of a structured therapeutic interruption on the length of time it takes the virus to "rebound" after stopping antiretroviral therapy.

Get ready to put your new Python skills to the test as we delve into the data and discover what it has to reveal!

## Special Instructions

Any needed, likely a nothing.

## Learning Activities


### Read: Textbook

Read [Module 3 in QRiB](https://damlabresources.github.io/quantitative-reasoning-in-biology/content/Module03/Module03_book.html).

### Participate: Lecture Walkthrough

Get ready to dive into some data analysis as we explore the effectiveness of a hypothetical HIV treatment trial.
HIV cure style trials rely on structured therapeutic interventions (STI)s in which volunteers recieve a new treatment and forgoe thier standard medication under close doctor supervision.
We consider a treatment effective if it can prolong the time between the removal of standard treatment and viral rebound compared to a control group.
In this walkthrough, we have a dataset containing information from 30 people living with HIV (PLWH) who were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group.
After receiving the treatment, they stopped antiretroviral therapy (ART) and were monitored weekly.
Once “detectable” viral load was found, researchers noted it and resumed their standard therapy.
We will use Pandas to analyze this data and evaluate the treatment effectiveness.
By the end of this activity, you will be proficient in loading spreadsheet data into Python, creating derived columns in DataFrames, and using summary methods like sum, mean, and max. 

**Learning Objectives**

During this learning activity we will:

* Practice loading spreadsheet data into Python using pandas.
* Use Python methods to create derived columns in pd.DataFrames.
* Use Pandas summary methods like sum, mean, and max.
* Employ basic filtering and data extraction from pandas. 

Let’s get started!


### Complete: Lab

In this lab, you will use Python to analyze data from a hypothetical HIV treatment trial and explore the effects of the treatment on different types of participants. Specifically, you will look at the infection status of participants at the start of the treatment and the length of their infection. These considerations have clinical implications for the application of the treatment. Through this activity, you will practice using Python methods to append a column to an existing table, load spreadsheet data into Python using the Table object, create derived columns in tables, and use Python summary methods like sum, mean, and max.

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this learning activity you will be able to:
* Use Python methods to append a column into an existing table.
* Practice loading spreadsheet data into Python using the Table object.
* Use Python methods to create derived columns in Tables
* Use Python summary methods like sum, mean, and max

## Conclusion

This week we covered loading speadsheets into Python DataFrame and then performed basic summaries.
These steps will form the foundation for all of the assignments moving forward.
You should also try loading in your spreadsheets into DataFrames and practicing these techniques.
Over the next two weeks, we will do this in a structured project in which you will load and summarize a dataset on your own.
