# Project 1: Data Description

## Introduction and Overview

The first step in any data science project is identifying and working with a dataset.
This phase is essential for developing your ability to independently find, evaluate, and manipulate data—skills that are invaluable in both academic and professional settings.
By finding and loading a dataset yourself, you gain hands-on experience with critical aspects of the data science process: locating relevant data, assessing its quality, and preparing it for analysis.

In this first part of the project, you will choose a dataset that captures your interest—either a dataset of your own or one from the publicly available TidyTuesday GitHub repository.
Once selected, you will load the dataset into Python using Pandas, a versatile library designed for handling and analyzing data.
This exercise will familiarize you with the dataset’s structure, key columns, and types of data it contains, allowing you to start identifying meaningful questions and analytical directions.

The utility of finding and loading the dataset yourself lies in the process: you develop the ability to assess real-world datasets critically, identify the challenges they present, and take the first steps to clean and prepare them for analysis.
By the end of this part, you will have a strong foundation for deeper exploration and analysis in the next phases. Furthermore, collaboration and feedback from your peers will help refine your understanding and enhance the project’s overall value.

## General Instructions for Completing Weekly Coursework

## Office Hours
There are office hours on Monday, 8PM in the Course Zoom Room. If you have questions, this is a good time to get help.

## Special Instructions/Notes

There is an optional Show & Tell Monday at 8PM on 2/10 at the Course Zoom Room.
Come and show off the project that you found!

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Identify and locate relevant datasets from open data repositories.
- Load datasets into Python using Pandas.
- Interpret the meaning of columns and their data types.
- Propose potential research questions or hypotheses based on the dataset's features.
- Create a structured forum post summarizing your dataset selection, its features, and your initial thoughts on its analysis potential.
- Provide constructive feedback on peer posts, offering suggestions for improving dataset use or exploring new angles for analysis.

## Dataset Ideas

Here are some good places to find datasets:
- TidyTuesday - A weekly collection of curate small to medium sized datasets across a range of topics. 
- Kaggle Datasets - A giant collections of public datasets.
- Work spreadsheets - Got a cool spreadsheet you add numbers into every day at work? Want to make graphs and answer questions about it. This is a perfect time to take the initiative and do something cool.
- Hobby, Fitness, Health Tracker app - Do you track your workouts? Do you wear a smart watch? Most of these apps have an export functionality that allow you to get a 'csv' of what it has recorded. These make great datasets and are a lot of fun to explore.

When choosing a dataset beware of Synthetic Data, which is common on the Kaggle website.
This is "fake" data and does not represent 


## Project Part 1

Welcome to the first phase of your data science project!
This thread will guide you through finding, evaluating, and loading a dataset.
Follow the instructions below to complete this part of the project and participate in peer discussions.

## Instructions


### Step 1: Find Your Dataset (Wednesday - Tuesday, Week 4)
  1. Choose a dataset:
    1. Use a dataset of your own or select one from the TidyTuesday GitHub repository.
    2. Ensure the dataset is interesting to you and has potential for meaningful analysis.
  2. Explore your dataset:
    1. Understand its purpose and structure.
    2. Identify key columns and their data types.
  3. Load your dataset:
    1. Use Python and Pandas in Google Colab to load your dataset.
    2. Use .head() to preview the first few rows.
    3. Use .describe() to describe each column.

### Step 2: Post on the Forum (By Tuesday)

Create a post in this thread that includes:

 - Dataset link: Provide a link to your dataset.
 - Why it’s interesting: Explain why you chose this dataset and what makes it engaging.
 - Description: Briefly describe the dataset and its relevant columns.
 - Pandas screenshot: Include a screenshot from Google Colab showing the output of df.head().
 - Questions: List 2-3 potential questions or hypotheses you’d like to explore with this dataset.

### Step 3: Engage with Peers (Tuesday - Tuesday, Week 5)

 - Review at least two posts from your classmates.
 - Provide thoughtful and constructive feedback by:
   - Suggesting additional questions or analyses.
   - Offering tips on dataset handling or interpretation.

### Tips for Success

 - When choosing a dataset, think about what interests you or aligns with your goals.
 - Be detailed in your description to help your peers understand your dataset.
 - Feedback should be encouraging and focus on improving the project.
Let the exploration begin!
