# Module 10: Power Analysis and Experimental Design

## Overview

This week we'll explore power analysis and how to design well-powered experiments.

## Learning Resources

### Having Trouble with Syntax or Errors?

If you're getting stuck on Python syntax or encountering errors, check out these helpful guides:

- **[Python Syntax Quick Reference](../misc/python_syntax_guide.md)** - Quick lookup for brackets, indexing, and common pandas operations
- **[Troubleshooting Common Errors](../misc/troubleshooting_errors.md)** - Understand and fix common Python errors

### Need More Practice?

- **[Module 10 Practice Problems](Module10_practice.ipynb)** - Optional practice problems with solutions (not graded)

## Learning Activities

### Read: Textbook

Review the textbook material on power analysis.

### Participate: Lecture Walkthrough  

Complete the Module 10 walkthrough notebook.

### Complete: Lab

Apply what you've learned in the Module 10 lab assignment.

## Getting Help

- **Office Hours**: Thursday 8 PM at the course Zoom link
- **Discussion Board**: Post conceptual questions
- **For coding help**: Attend office hours or TA sessions (coding errors are hard to diagnose asynchronously)

## Tips for Success

1. **Understand the four-way relationship** - power, sample size, effect size, and alpha are all connected
2. **Plan ahead** - Power analysis should happen BEFORE you collect data
3. **Use the guides** - The [syntax guide](../misc/python_syntax_guide.md) and [error guide](../misc/troubleshooting_errors.md) are there to help
4. **Practice calculations** - Try the optional practice problems with different scenarios
