    "In the COVID sequencing lab we often have to evaluate multiple techniques for preparing viral samples for sequencing.\n",
    "There are *many* aspects to this comparison, but one important one is the yield of the reaction that prepares DNA for sequencing.\n",
    "This reaction is called an RT-PCR reaction because it _reverse-transcribes_ the nCov2 RNA into DNA through a _polymerase chain reaction_.\n",

    "Currently, our lab uses a system with over 200 pairs of overlapping PCR primers that generate DNA fragments that are, on average, **285 basepairs** long.\n",

    "Short RT-PCR fragments are ideal when dealing with degraded RNA because it allows for the amplification of even shredded RNA.\n",

    "Congratulations on completing this lab! You have successfully compared the yield of two different RT-PCR methods for preparing viral samples for genomic sequencing.\n",
    "You have determined that the Nanopore system is ideal for degraded samples due to its shorter PCR fragments, while the PacBio system is better for fresher samples and is able to produce longer sequencing fragments.\n",
    "This is just the beginning of your journey with Python and data analysis.\n",
    "Keep up the great work as we continue to expand on these techniques and explore more complicated results in future assignments."
