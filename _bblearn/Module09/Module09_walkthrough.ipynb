    "Before we start, we need to talk about assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic linear regression has a number assumptions baked into itself:\n",
    " - **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable (outcome) is linear. This means that changes in the predictors lead to proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    " - **The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is additive**: The effect of changes in an independent variable X on the dependent variable Y is consistent, regardless of the values of other independent variables. This assumption might not hold if there are interaction effects between independent variables that affect the dependent variable.\n",
    " - **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other. This means that the observations do not influence each other, an assumption that is particularly important in time-series data where time-related dependencies can violate this assumption.\n",
    " - **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of error terms (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, as the predictor variable increases, the spread (variance) of the residuals remains constant. This is evaluated at the **end** of the fit.\n",
    " - **Normal Distribution of Errors**: The residuals (errors) of the model are normally distributed. This assumption is especially important for hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests of coefficients) and confidence interval construction. It's worth noting that for large sample sizes, the Central Limit Theorem helps mitigate the violation of this assumption. This is evaluated at the **end** of the fit.\n",
    " - **Minimal Multicollinearity**: The independent variables need to be independent of each other. Multicollinearity doesn't affect the fit of the model as much as it affects the coefficients' estimates, making them unstable and difficult to interpret.\n",
    " - **No perfect multicollinearity**: Also called the _dummy variable trap_. It states that none of the independent variables should be a perfect linear function of other independent variables. We'll talk more about this when we run into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biology itself is highly non-linear.\n",
    "That doesn't mean we can't use linear assumptions to explore biological questions, it just means that we need to be mindful when interpretting the results."

    "There are a number of regression based tools in `pingouin` that we didn't cover that may be useful to explore.\n",
    " - `pg.logistic_regression` : This works similar to linear regression but is for binary dependent variables.\n",
    "Each feature is regressed to create an equation that estimates the likelihood of the `dv` being `True`.\n",
    " - `pg.partial_corr` : Like the ANCOVA, this is a tool for removing the effect of covariates and then calculating a correlation coefficient.\n",
    " - `pg.rm_corr` : Correlation with repeated measures. This is useful if you have measured the same _sample_ multiple times and want to account for intermeasurment variability.\n",
    " - `pg.mediation_analysis` : Tests the hypothesis that the independent variable `X` influences the dependent variable `Y` by a change in mediator `M`; like so `X -> M -> Y`.\n",
    "This is useful to disentangle causal effects from covariation."
