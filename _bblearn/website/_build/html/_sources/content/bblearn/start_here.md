# Start Here

## Introduction

Blackboard Learn (also known as Drexel Learn, Bb Learn, or LEARN) is a private and secure website called a Learning Management System or LMS. Blackboard Learn is where you access your course material, interact with your instructors and other students, submit assignments, complete assessments, and view your grades. To become familiar with how to navigate Bb Learn and use the essential tools, review the Blackboard Learn Student Help.
Read the instructions below to learn how to get started and complete each section below. You will need 10-15 minutes to complete the *Start Here* section.

## Read Instructions

This *Start Here* section provides an orientation to your course, familiarizes you with the course organization and components, and lists technology requirements. Most details in this section are course-specific. However, some information pertains to the Microbiology and Immunology graduate programs, Blackboard (Bb) Learn, and University policies and procedures. You must review this entire section and complete all activities. Completing the *Start Here* tasks prepares you to succeed in this course and avoid common issues that sometimes frustrate learners. Therefore, you should complete them before continuing with the weekly topics. If you have any difficulty or questions, don't hesitate to contact your course director(s).
You may be inclined to skip the information specific to technical support, academic policies, communications policies, or other information because you are already familiar with these details. The specifics are mostly the same for each course. However, you are responsible for knowing all requirements, policies, and procedures and how to use essential Blackboard (Bb) Learn tools. Therefore, you may wish to review this information at least once each semester.
