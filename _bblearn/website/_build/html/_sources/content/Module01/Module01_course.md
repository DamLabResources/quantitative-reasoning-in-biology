# Module 1

## Introduction and Overview

Welcome to the first week of Applied Statistics for Biomedical Sciences.

Welcome to Week 1 of our 16-week exploration of biological data analysis! 
This week, we will start by introducing you to the Google Colab environment and Python programming.

Throughout this course, we will work with a variety of datasets including clinical information from people living with HIV, high-content cell imaging, and rodent behavioral data.
While the specific data may vary, the techniques used to load, visualize, and analyze it will be consistent.

To get started, please watch the introductions from your instructional team.
After that, you can begin working through the Learning Activities for this week which include completing the paired programming walkthrough and taking a brief quiz.

I am looking forward to diving into the exciting world of data analysis with you all!

## About Weekly Coursework


Each week you will open a page like this one.
I have organized the pages into the same general structure:
 - Introduction and Overview
 - Special Instructions/Notes, as needed
 - Required synchronous sessions, if any
 - * Learning Activities *
 - Conclusion/Wrap-up

This course runs a Wed->Tue instructional week.
I expect that you will start working on the Week's material on Wednesday to turn in the assignments by Tuesday.
All assignments are marked with a Due Date in BBLearn for 11:59 PM on the Tuesday of each week.
Assignments turned in after the due date will receive an automatic reduction of 10% per week.

The *Learning Activities* section contains the various assignments you will complete to learn the key terms, concepts, methods, etc. related to biomedical statistics and how to apply them in your current or future work. 
In general, but not always, the series of learning activities are to:
 - Read textbook material. (~30 min) 
 - Review available supplemental materials (1 hr) 
 - Complete the paired programming walkthrough. (1-2hr) 
 - Complete the lab. (1-3 hr) 

You should be working on and completing your assignment **EACH WEEK**.
Allowing assignments to slip will make completing the next week more difficult, please be mindful not to fall behind on your work.
If you are having difficulty with your assignments reach out for help **sooner** rather than **later**.

## Special Instructions

This week, there is a required synchronous session.
Join this Zoom Room at 8:00 PM on Thursday.
While not required, I suggest you watch the first video and complete the quiz before attending.

## Learning Objectives

The learning objectives are an essential instructional element as they tell you where to focus your learning efforts and how.
Therefore, this course will post weekly learning objectives with the associated learning activities to provide you with better guidance.
At the end of each week or assignment, re-read the learning objectives and make sure that you have completed them.

## Learning Activities

This section contains the learning activities you need to complete by the end of each week.

### Read: Textbook

Find and bookmark the online textbook for this course [Quantitative Reasoning in Biology](https://damlabresources.github.io/quantitative-reasoning-in-biology).
This is a _living textbook_ that I will update as students ask questions, need clarifications, etc.
Check back with the textbook throughout the week as I will update it in response to questions in the discussion board.
The book is also Hypothesis Enabled allowing you to highlight and add notes directly on the website.

### Participate: Lecture Walkthrough

Google Colab is a powerful tool researchers and data scientists use to write & execute code, analyze data, and collaborate on projects from anywhere with an internet connection.
It's free to use and requires no setup or installation, making it an ideal platform for data analysis tasks.

In this week's learning activity, we will introduce you to the basics of using Google Colab.
We'll show you how to log in, execute code, write text using Markdown, and export your work for submission. 

You don't need to have anything downloaded or installed in advance of this activity.
We will cover everything during the video.

By following along with the video, you'll learn how to:

 - Launch Google Colab
 - Create text using Markdown.
 - Execute code cells.
 - Check your answers with the `Otter` grading system.
 - Submit assignments to BBLearn.

Google Colab is widely used by researchers around the world and is an important tool to have in your data analysis toolkit.
After completing this learning activity, you'll have a strong foundation in using Google Colab and be well on your way to using it to tackle real-world data problems.
Please make sure to respond to the quiz questions as they appear in the video.

Note:

When downloading the files, it's important that you don't unzip them.
If your browser unzips them automatically during the download process, you will need to turn this feature off.
The steps to do this vary depending on which browser you are using (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.).
To find out how to disable this feature in your browser, try searching online for a phrase like "how to stop [browser name] from unzipping downloaded files."

If you continue to have difficulty with this, you can schedule a meeting through the booking link to get help from an instructor.

### Complete: Lab

None this week.

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this first week of exploring data analysis! 
By getting familiar with Google Colab, you've laid the foundation for the next 16 weeks of this course.

In the next week, we'll continue to use Google Colab as we delve into basic math and calculating dilutions.
We'll apply these concepts to a real-world scenario, using Google Colab to perform calculations related to running a Nanopore sequencing run.
These skills will be crucial as we move forward in the course and tackle more complex data analysis tasks.

I am excited to see what you'll be able to accomplish as you continue to develop your skills in data analysis.
I hope this first week has sparked your curiosity and interest in this field, and I look forward to diving deeper into these topics with you in the weeks ahead.
